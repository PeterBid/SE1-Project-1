## Brief 

Design and create a grid-based game using HTML, CSS and JavaScript, utilising the knowledge gained from the first three weeks of the SEI course. The game should be playable for one player, and the player must be able to win and lose the game. 

Solo project. 

Timeframe: 1 week.

## Deployment

## Concept

I chose to create a theme based around the Final Fantasy series and the character "Vivi" from Final Fantasy 9 specifically. I made this decision as I believed that I could embrace my creativity, constructing a new scenario that both reflected similarities to the 'frogger' storyline while also embracing Final Fantasy. 

This is shown with the focus on adventures, overcoming various obstacles and an attempt to make it back home within a time limit.

With Vivi and his Allies under threat from numerous enemies, the aim of the game is to make them pass different bandits and monsters safely within a time limit and without losing all three lives. Along the way, they can ride a bird to aid their journey home.

### Planning

Planning (day 1)

First, I started with a wire frame, a pseudo-code, and also wrote down steps I wished to achive each day in order to achieve as many functionalities as possible for my game.
