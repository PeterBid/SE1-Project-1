## Brief 

Design and create a grid-based game using HTML, CSS and JavaScript, utilising the knowledge gained from the first three weeks of the SEI course. The game should be playable for one player, and the player must be able to win and lose the game. 

Solo project. 

Timeframe: 1 week.

## Deployment

Please follow this link to play my game: https://peterbid.github.io/Vivi-Adventure-Game/

## Concept

I chose to create a theme based around the Final Fantasy series and the character "Vivi" from Final Fantasy 9 specifically. I made this decision as I believed that I could embrace my creativity, constructing a new scenario that both reflected similarities to the 'frogger' storyline while also embracing Final Fantasy. 

This is shown with the focus on adventures, overcoming various obstacles and an attempt to make it back home within a time limit.

With Vivi and his Allies under threat from numerous enemies, the aim of the game is to make them pass different bandits and monsters safely within a time limit and without losing all three lives. Along the way, they can ride a bird to aid their journey home.

## Process

### Planning

First, I started with a wire frame, a pseudo-code, and also wrote down steps I wished to achive each day in order to achieve as many functionalities as possible for my game.

#### Wire Frame

### Creating the Games Functionality with JavaScript  

#### Making the Grid

After learning about DOM before starting the project, I decided to build the grid with JavaScript. Due to this, I didn't need to hard code the grid inside the HTML file with different divs. 

I created a div in the HTML with a class name of `'grid'`. The `'grid'` class was then called in the app.js with querySelector. I then used an empty array called `cells` which for the divs, created with DOM. I decided my grid would have 100 cells/divs. 

I created a function using a for-loop that repeated 100 times and created a new `cell` child div every time. They were stored inside the array `cells` using `appendChild`. I then called the function for the grid to be displayed in the browser.
